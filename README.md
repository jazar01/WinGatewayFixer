# WinGatewayFixer
/*
 * WinGatewayFixer checks the specified network adapter to see if it has
 * at least one gateway specified.  If not the adapter is set to DHCP.
 * 
 * This program was written because my computer was constantly losing its
 * gateway for no apparent reason. 
 * 
 * Usage: 
 * 
 * WinGatewayFixer "Adapter" [-q]
 * 
 * the optional -q causes this program to run in silent mode.
